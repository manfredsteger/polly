The failure occurred in the test sollte eine Terminumfrage erstellen können in e2e/poll-creation.spec.ts, specifically on this line:

```typescript
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /erfolgreich erstellt/i })).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
```

The error message is:

Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded.  
waiting for navigation to "**/success**" until "load"  
Error: page.waitForURL: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded.

This indicates that, after submitting the poll, the app did not navigate to the /success page within the expected 30 seconds, and the confirmation heading did not appear. Additionally, the logs show repeated PostgreSQL errors: "role 'root' does not exist". This suggests a backend issue, likely that the test app's backend cannot connect to the database with the expected credentials, resulting in the poll creation silently failing.

To resolve:

1. Ensure your PostgreSQL setup for CI includes a user matching your app’s configuration. The logs suggest the app is trying to connect as user root, which does not exist in the default Postgres setup.
   - Either add this user during DB setup in your workflow, or
   - Change your app/test DB config to use the default postgres user or another valid user.
2. In your GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml), review any service or DB container setup steps and DB environment variables. For example, add a step to create the user:
   ```yaml
   - name: Create database user
     run: |
       psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER root WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';"
       psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER root CREATEDB;"
   ```
   Or adjust your test config (env variables or test setup) to use a user already available (such as postgres).

3. For immediate triage, locally check the behavior with an intentionally misconfigured DB user and verify that the /success navigation only happens when the backend is reachable and poll creation succeeds.

Adjust your DB setup or app config so the workflow database user exists and has necessary permissions, then rerun the test—the navigation and heading checks should succeed.
